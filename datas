Place this file in /etc/init.d and make it executable.

sudo mv listen-for-shutdown.sh /etc/init.d/
sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/listen-for-shutdown.sh

Now we'll register the script to run on boot.

sudo update-rc.d listen-for-shutdown.sh defaults

Since the script won't be running, we'll go ahead and start it with:

sudo /etc/init.d/listen-for-shutdown.sh start

Note: These scripts have been added to a Github repo to make them easier to pull down. Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements.
